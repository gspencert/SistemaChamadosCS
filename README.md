# SistemaChamadosCS

Simple help desk system made in C# using Console Application.

This project was created to practice programming logic, code organization and basic CRUD operations.

## Features
- Create a support ticket (chamado)
- List all tickets
- Save tickets to a CSV file
- Load tickets from a CSV file
- Menu navigation using switch case

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET
- Console Application

## Project Structure
- Program.cs: responsible only for the menu and flow control
- Funcoes.cs: contains all business logic
- Chamado.cs: ticket model

## How it works
The application runs in the console and shows a menu.
The user can create, list and save tickets.
All data is stored in a CSV file to simulate persistence.

## Goal
This project is part of my learning process as a Back-End developer using C# and .NET.
It focuses on clean logic, separation of responsibilities and code readability.
